The `securitytools` project is a collection of open-source tools and resources for those in the realm of computer security.

The `projects/` directory is organized as a set of folders, each containing submodules that link to individual tools and resources.

The [securitytools](https://joshhighet.github.io/securitytools) site provides a centralized view of all of the projects and tools within.
